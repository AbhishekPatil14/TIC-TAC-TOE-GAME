Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player game where the objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of one's own markers. The game is played on a 3x3 grid. One player uses the symbol "X" and the other uses "O." Players take turns marking an empty cell on the grid with their symbol. The game starts with an empty board, and players alternate turns until one player achieves a line of three symbols or all cells are filled, resulting in a draw if no player has lined up three symbols. Tic Tac Toe is a simple yet strategic game that challenges players to think ahead and block their opponent's moves while trying to complete their own sequence.
